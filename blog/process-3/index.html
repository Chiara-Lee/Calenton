The primary motion is provided by rotating the workpiece, and the feed motion is achieved by moving the cutting tool slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece.</p><p>Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two or four helical cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpiece to form the round hole.</p><p>In boring, a tool with a single bent pointed tip is advanced into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a fine finishing operation used in the final stages of product manufacture.</p><p>Reaming is one of the sizing operations that removes a small amount of metal from a hole already drilled.</p><p>In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is moved slowly relative to the material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool&rsquo;s axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are:</p><ul><li>Peripheral milling</li><li>Face milling.</li></ul><p>Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching and sawing.

<a href=https://chiara-lee.netlify.app/blog/process-2/><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part II</h2><article>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><img alt="Our Manufacturing Process Part I" loading=lazy src=https://chiara-lee.netlify.app/blog/process-1/cover_hu8f8e1bfda069c7a1b75f77464cdd1ac7_859432_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg>
<a href=https://chiara-lee.netlify.app/blog/process-1/><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part I</h2><article>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</article><div>Read More</div></a></li></ul></div><div class=comments><h2>Comments</h2><template id=comment-success><div class=success>您的评论已成功提交审核。(´｡• ᵕ •｡`)</div></template><template id=comment-error><div class=error>啊，好像出了些问题，请您调整后重试。(；′⌒`)</div></template><form id=comment-form data-dynamic-form data-success=#comment-success data-error=#comment-error netlify=true name=Comments><div id=reply-to style=display:none;color:#6c757d;margin-bottom:10px></div><input type=hidden name=url value=/blog/process-3/>
